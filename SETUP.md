# Coachify Setup Guide

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Stripe Configuration (Required for payments)
# These are SECRET keys - never commit these to git!
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: Firebase configuration is hardcoded in `lib/firebase/config.ts`. Firebase client config values (apiKey, projectId, etc.) are safe to expose publicly - security is handled by Firebase Security Rules and domain restrictions in the Firebase Console.

## Stripe Setup

1. Create a Stripe account at https://stripe.com
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. Set up webhooks:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
   - Copy the webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Firebase Setup

1. The Firebase config is already set up in `lib/firebase/config.ts`
2. Make sure your Firestore security rules allow:
   - Public read access to published coaches, courses, articles
   - User write access to their own data
   - Admin access for admin role

3. Set up Firestore indexes for:
   - `coaches` collection: `status`, `isVerified`, `sports` (array-contains)
   - `courses` collection: `isPublished`, `sport`, `skillLevel`
   - `articles` collection: `status`, `sport`
   - `bookings` collection: `coachId`, `studentId`, `scheduledStart`
   - `videos` collection: `coachId`, `isFree`, `visibility`

## Creating an Admin User

To create an admin user, manually update the user document in Firestore:

1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore
2. Find the user document in the `users` collection
3. Update the `role` field to `"admin"`

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Production Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel
```

3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard

4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your production URL

5. Update Stripe webhook URL to point to your production domain
